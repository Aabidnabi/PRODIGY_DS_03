## Technology Stack:

- **Python:** Primary programming language for the project.
- **Scikit-learn:** Utilized for building the decision tree classifier.
- **Pandas and NumPy:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Employed for data visualization.
- **GitHub:** Version control and collaborative development.

## Project Structure:

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebook(s) with the code for data preprocessing, model training, and analysis.
- **Data:** Contains the Bank Marketing dataset.
- **Results:** Visualizations and insights obtained from the analysis.
- **Screenshots:** Screenshots of key visualizations and results.
- **README.md:** Detailed information about the project.
